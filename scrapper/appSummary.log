** Summary **
    Bangladesh's non-leather footwear industry faces a major setback as a new tariff from the US threatens its growth and global competitiveness. The industry had been gaining traction in the global synthetic shoe market, but the 50% tariff on synthetic footwear shipments to the US could reverse this trend.
    The increased tariff has already caused many exporters to postpone or cancel orders, and local shoe-makers fear that it could erase their price advantage and push buyers towards Vietnam.

** Summary **
The article discusses the relationship between Bangladeshi parents and their children, highlighting two distinct approaches to parenting: one that respects individuality and another that micromanages every aspect of a child's life.
Parents who grew up in post-independence Bangladesh often struggled with uncertainty and had to sacrifice their own aspirations for financial stability, leading them to want their children to succeed on their terms.
The article raises questions about the impact of this approach on the lives of children and whether they are truly living or just existing.

    Bengali writer Mahruba T. Mowtushi's book explores how the continent of Africa has been perceived and written about by Bengalis over the decades, tracing the evolution of their attitudes towards the continent.
    The book focuses on five writers who have depicted Africa in their works, including Rabindranath Tagore, Ganesh Bagchi, and Rajat Neogy, and examines the impact of colonialism and nationalism on their writing.
    Mowtushi's work is a testament to her own nostalgia for Africa and her desire to identify imaginatively with a world and people she had valued but had been distanced from by time and circumstances.
